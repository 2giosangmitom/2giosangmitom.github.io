# Hi, I'm Vo Quang Chien

My passion for building websites started when I was 17 years old. In 2024, I started my university journey, my main focus is web development. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer with expertise in both frontend and backend technologies. My favorite technologies are Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Node.js.

## Development Philosophy

I believe in the power of simplicity and clarity in code. I strive to write clean, maintainable code that solves real business problems.

- **Code quality**: Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Using strict TypeScript practices, comprehensive testing, and consistent code style through ESLint and Prettier.
- **Performance**: Ensuring that my applications are fast and responsive. Optimizing code and leveraging modern web technologies to deliver the best user experience.
- **Correctness**: Always write tests for my code to ensure its correctness and reliability. I use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (infrequently) tests to cover different aspects of my applications.

## Personal Achievements

- **Open Source Contributor**: I have contributed to several open-source projects on GitHub, helping to improve documentation, add new features, and fix bugs.
- **The ICPC HUSC**: I participated in the ICPC HUSC (Hue University of Science) and luckily achieved the bronze medal in 2024. At that time, I was just a freshman.

## Other Interests

Beyond coding, I enjoy reading books about technology, spend time for family and outdoor activities.

I'm also a big fan of martial arts and gym. I follow various martial arts events like UFC, ONE Championship, LION Championship, GMA, and more.
