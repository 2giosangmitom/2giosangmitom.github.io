## 💻 Programming Books

### The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)

📖 _By Bjarne Stroustrup_

Written by the **creator of C++**, this book is the **definitive guide** to mastering the language. It covers **everything from fundamental syntax to advanced features** like **templates, concurrency, and memory management**. I read this when I was a first-year university student, and it was the first programming book I've ever completed. In my experience, this book isn't beginner-friendly, but if you already have some programming experience, you'll find it incredibly valuable. This book is a must-read for anyone serious about C++.

📖 _By Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein_

This is one of the most detailed books about **data structures and algorithm** (DSA). It covers most popular data structures and algorithms, complexity analysis.
