Hello! In this blog, I'd like to share some books that have made a strong impression on me. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I highly recommend them!

## 📚 Database Books

### Database Systems: Design, Implementation, & Management (14th Edition)

📖 _By Carlos Coronel & Steven Morris_

This book provides a **comprehensive introduction** to database concepts, relational models, and SQL. It covers **database design, normalization, indexing, and optimization** in a structured way, making it great for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Why I Recommend It:**

- Covers both **theory and practical implementation**.
- Explains **normalization and database design** in an detailed and easy to understand manner.
- Includes **real-world examples and exercises** to reinforce concepts.

## 💻 Programming Books

### The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)

📖 _By Bjarne Stroustrup_

Written by the **creator of C++**, this book is the **definitive guide** to mastering the language. It covers **everything from fundamental syntax to advanced features** like **templates, concurrency, and memory management**. I read this when I was a first-year university student, and it was the first programming book I've ever completed. In my experience, this book isn't beginner-friendly, but if you already have some programming experience, you'll find it incredibly valuable.

**Why I Recommend It:**

- Written by **Bjarne Stroustrup**, the designer of C++.
- Covers **modern C++ (C++11 and later)** in depth.
- Explains **best practices and language philosophy**, not just syntax.

### JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (7th Edition)

📖 _By David Flanagan_

This is one of the most comprehensive books for mastering JavaScript. It covers everything from **fundamentals to advanced concepts**, including JavaScript's core features, object-oriented programming, inheritance, asynchronous programming, generators, and even Node.js.

**Why I Recommend It:**

- Covers JavaScript from basics to advanced topics
- Provides in-depth explanations with clear examples
- Beginner-friendly yet valuable for experienced developers
