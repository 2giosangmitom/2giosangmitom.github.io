# From Rock Bottom to Pirate King: My journey into programming

I was once a poor-performing student - always at the bottom of the class, looked down on by both teachers and classmates for years. Back then, I was addicted to games, had no goals, and absolutely no self-discipline.

By the time I realized how far behind I had fallen, it felt too late. Time kept moving, yet I wasn't growing. Even when I met my high school buddies, I was still the same - no real progress.

But one day, something clicked: I needed a passion, something to build a future with.

That's when I found programming.

I still remember the second semester of 11th grade - that was the first time we learned `Pascal`. And for the first time in my life, I _enjoyed_ doing something. Every computer class, I would open Vim to code in Pascal just to feel cool. (Some girls even started liking me more from that point haha.) From then on, I made a promise to master just one thing and master it well.

In 12th grade, despite having to relearn the basics of several subjects for university entrance exams, I still carved out time to study HTML and CSS. I was learning a bit of everything without understanding much - but I was curious and hungry.

Once I got into university, things became more serious. I started reading more books, mapping out my own learning path, and becoming more disciplined.

When I first entered college, I didn't even know how to code in C++. But fortunately, I met some amazing seniors - real "bosses" in my eyes. They were strong, focused, and became my motivation to keep improving, hoping one day I could be on their level.

I also stopped texting girls altogether - to focus on myself.

I've been slow. I've been left behind.
But now, I _know_ what I want. And I'll give it everything I've got.
From now on, nothing can stop me.

**I will become the Pirate King.**
